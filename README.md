# ASL Translator Project

The goal of this project was just for me to get an understanding of how machine vision works, i might continue it later if it were to be selected as my thesis

# ðŸš€ Features

- Data Collector Script:
  will collect data to any camera connected to ur pc, just read my comments and edit it.
- Keras Model:
  Already working model, though it suck because i have only trained it using around 300 images per class, thus it have a bias to my dataset's background which is my bedroom cabinet lol

You can use the data collector to collect your own dataset and train your own model if you want, just update the file location of the new model in the code

# ðŸ“¦ INSTALLATION on CMD

1. git clone https://github.com/Cheemsburb/ASL-Translator-Project.git
2. cd "ASL COMPUTER VISION"
3. python -m venv venv
4. venv\Scripts\activate.bat
5. pip install -r requirements.txt
6. python test.py

# TLDR: i've only created this to learn so this project only works well if you have my cabinet as your background lol
